Animation Viewer for Mac
========================

Why?
----
Animation viewer is a simple tool I needed for a project, where artist works without proper development environment. With this simple tool, the artist can open the frames and see if the animation works.

Later, the image files (.png) are compiled into proper sprite sheets with TexturePacker or similar tool.

Installation
------------
Open the animationviewer.xcodeproj with XCode4 and run.

Usage
-----
1. Select the frames in order. At least .png and .jpg files work.
2. Watch the animation rolling.
3. Use up/down or left/right to adjust the speed.
4. Press space to toggle repeating/unrepeating.

It's made with Cocos2D for Mac. Completely free to use however you want. Provided without warranties or anything :)
